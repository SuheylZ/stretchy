A UI for editing and maintaining index. also generates the code in typescript for accessing the indices. 

## Objective
We often face the issue when it comes to integrating ElasticSearch to ay project. teams take time to explore and then integrate. Sometimes the code is not right, besides, who is interested in writing boilerplate code everytime. 
With this small utility with its UI, it makes it a bit easier to do that. 

1. implement the index in elastic search
2. generate the boilerplate code (to search and to manage index)

Kibana already does many things but there were few things we needed a few things, for instance we don't want to interact with the ElasticSearch REST api.   

This tool is free to use. Kindly use it for personal and development purpose only. It is not recomended to use this tool for production environment. 
The people who manage this tool take no responsibility for any data loss in your elastic search by using this tool or the code generated through it.
